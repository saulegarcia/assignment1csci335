# assignment1csci335
The README file should include the following:
i. Which parts of your assignment were completed: none but to be fair, I'm really confused, but I will figure this out please give me a chance
ii. Any bugs that you have encountered: I have encountered a lot of bugs, but still can't fix them
iii. Complete instructions of how to run your program(s): I'm asking for help but so far I just got the example code right now, because I'm still trying to find out how to do it on my own
iv. The input file (if any) and the output files (if any).
Not yet :/
